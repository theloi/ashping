DESCRIPTION

	hping2 is a network tool able to send custom ICMP/UDP/TCP
	packets and to display target replies like ping do with
	ICMP replies. hping2 handle fragmentation, arbitrary packet
	body and size and can be used in order to transfer files
	under supported protocols. Using hping2 you are able at
	least to perform the following jobs:

	- Test firewall rules
	- [spoofed] port scanning
	- Test net performance using differents protocols,
	  packet size, TOS (type of service) and fragmentation.
	- Path MTU discovery
	- Files trasfering even between really fascist firewall rules.
	- Traceroute like under different protocols.
	- Firewalk like usage.
	- Remote OS fingerprint.
	- TCP/IP stack auditing.
	- A lot of others.

	It's also really a good didactic tool to learn TCP/IP.

	hping2 is developed and manteined by antirez@invece.org
	and comes under GPL version 2 of license. Developing is
	open so you can send me patches/suggestions/affronts without
	inhibitions.
