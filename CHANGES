TO FIX before ??:
* The problem with --rroute and the IP header length field on SunOS,
  thanks to Graeme Hewson <graeme.hewson@oracle.com> for reporting it.

MM FIX: Fix for interface guessing with aliases on BSD
	Thanks <michel.gravey(@)orange.fr> and <cognet(@)freebsd.org>
MM FIX: fixed cksum.c. Bad outgoing packet checksum with some packet.
	Thanks to Brett Eldridge <beldridg@pobox.com>.
AZ ADD: scan mode (--scan)
AZ ADD: A rc4-based PRNG to use with --rand-source and --rand-dest
NJ FIX: Fix -I option for BSD/Apple
NJ ADD: Add support for BSDI and MacOSX (thanks 
        Dennis Opacki <dopacki@adotout.com> and Jan-Hinrich Fessel 
        <Jan-Hinrich.Fessel@T-Mobile.de>)
HK ADD: A few useful ICMP options
NJ ADD: Add support for :
	WLAN (Fabian Melzow <biop0b@web.de>)
	ATM (Debian bug #193436, thanks to Domenico Andreoli)
	Token Ring (jim.r.halfpenny@britishairways.com)
NJ ADD: MacOSX patches (Hans-Joachim Knobloch <knobloch@secorvo.de>)
NJ FIX: --rand-source patches from Quentin Garnier <hping@quatriemek.com>
	. ensure randomness
	. do not stop on errors when using a E or D class address (BSD only?)

20 Nov 2002 -- 2.0.0 stable -- candidate release 2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

NJ FIX: The bug about port number printing in TCP mode than YB discovered.
NJ ADD: MTU value sanity check in option parsing.
NJ FIX: Fix the use of -W option
NJ ADD: strLcpy() function taken from OpenBSD
NJ FIX: Fix a bug when using BSD and a PPP link as a default route
        Move code from routing sockets to get_output_if function.
BJ FIX/ADD: source routing and random bugfixes. Thanks BJ!
AZ ADD: --rand-source for random source addresses.
AZ FIX: all the atoi() call was replaced with strto[u]l().
MM FIX: seq/ack setting using strtoul() instead of atoi(), thanks
        to Shachar Shemesh <sun@consumer.org.il>.
AZ ADD: --rand-dest for random destination addresses + manpage update.
AZ FIX/ADD: Major code rewrite.
AZ FIX: DF added to the icmp and udp output.
AZ FIX: --port ++<base> fixed with UDP and enhanced for TCP/UDP. Now the
        packets matches only with a sport that is:
	>= base_dest_port AND <= current_dest_port.
	Thanks to David Bar <dbar@Checkpoint.com> for the original
	report.

15 Aug 2001 -- 2.0.0 stable -- candidate release 1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

AZ FIX: --fast now really sends 10packets/second, not 100. Thanks
	to DD for the report.
AZ FIX: bzero/bcopy replaced with the sane memset/memcpy.
DG ADD: Solaris port, with the help of the patch contributed by
        Steve Bleazard <steve@bleazard.com>
AZ ADD: Changed a bit the format (flags=S is now <S>) and add the string
        DF if the don't fragment bit is on.
AZ FIX: waitpacket.c to take the data aligned. Now hping seems to
        work without problems on linux/sparc.
AZ FIX: getifname.c, now even the linux version behaves better locking
        for the interface address of the outgoing interface according
	to the kernel routing table. getdefaultif.c removed, no loger used.
AZ FIX --tr-stop enhanced (now really exit when an expected packet that
         was not an ICMP time exceeded was received)
AZ FIX: --stop-tr is now --tr-stop. All the traceroute mode options
        starts with --tr.
AZ ADD: --tr-no-rtt to turn off RTT information in traceroute mode.
        Thanks to Denis Ducamp for the idea.
AZ FIX: Now provide traceroute RTT information even with ICMP.
AZ ADD: --stop-tr stops hping in traceroute mode once the first non
        ICMP packet is received. Thanks to Denis Ducamp for the idea.
AZ ADD: ICMP subnet address mask support. Not tested.
AZ ADD: TCP timestamp support with HZ and uptime guessing (--tcp-timestamp)
AZ ADD: ICMP timestamp support (--icmptype 13)
AZ FIX: Fixed getlhs.c under BSD to get the header length from the like type.
YB NH AZ FIX: ICMP ID handling on systems with 32 bit pids.
DD ADD: Man page update (not french one!)
AZ ADD: --traceroute now prints RTT information.
AZ ADD: --traceroute now implies --ttl 1 if no --ttl option is specified.
AZ ADD: --fast option that is an alias for -u i10000 (10 packets at second)
MM ADD: ets.* interface (thanks to Stefano Brandimarte.)
AZ FIX: compilation problem (NULL used without including stdlib.h in getusec.c)
AZ FIX: -H switch (alternative to --protoip) thanks to
      "roy kozzer" <royk50@hotmail.com>
MM FIX: Man page grammatical mistakes, thanks to Jason Lunz <j@trellisinc.com>,
     I applied the patch by hand, so maybe some mistake is still inside.
FP FIX: fixed rtt/sequence number handling, now hping2 can run for hours
        keeping the right rtt calculation. Some sentence from the original
	Francesco's email:

I am  using it to make long  measurements of the response  times of http
servers around the world, so hping2 keeps running for days.  In fact, it
is apparently impossible to use  hping2 this way, as the sequence number
wraps around (and  this may be okay, in principle)  and the program goes
astray.

Precisely, the delay measurements are set  to 0 after  the wrap around.
Since  hping2 is  written so  cleanly (thanks),  I was  able  to quickly
correct the problem:
(strange, I think hping2 is very hugly code... I wrote it with
 too little coding experience)
 
BTW now the issue is fixed, MANY thanks to Francesco Portori'.

DD FIX: -seqnum (endianess IIRC) fixed.
DD FIX: Random fix to manpage and code.
NJ FIX/ADD: BSD network interfaces related code.
DD ADD: French translation of the hping documentation, under docs/french/

6 July 2000 -- 2.0.0 beta54, raw IP mode, bug fixing, NetBSD support, ...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solaris support still not present, a patch was provided by
Lorenzo Lazzieri but I did not have a solaris box to perform
some test, give me some solarix 2.[67] root account if you
need hping2 ported to solaris. Sorry, but my sparc S4 died
not long ago.

FIX: the stupid nop.c no longer exist.
FIX: tcp sequence number and ack visualization bug for lacks of ntohl()!
FIX: minor coding bugs fixed, minor code cleanup
FIX: man pages path now is obtained from MANPATH
FIX: new *BSD ethernet under getlhs.c
ADD: NetBSD support (thanks to Yann Berthier)
ADD: settable checksum
ADD: now TCP sequence number and ack are settable.
SA ADD: bad checksum option (-b --badcksum).
ADD: settable fragment offset.
ADD: raw IP mode.
ADD: out of sequence packets counter (only with -r option).
ADD: documentation updated and a bit improved.

20 Nov 1999 -- 2.0.0 beta 53, important bug fixed
-------------------------------------------------

Contrary to my hope this beta go out without Solaris support nor deep
testing under BSD systems. This because beta-53 FIX: some important bugs
so I think it's better to release it as soon as possible. I hope that
beta-54 will be more tested under BSD and will contain a first Solaris
support. Please, send me bug report/suggestions first beta-54 release, AZ

AZ ADD: man page updated.
AZ FIX: a very dirty bug introduced in hping2-beta49, it was in waitpacket.c,
   all offset was computed using the ip header length of the last packet, and
   for the first incoming packet using uninitialized bytes. I suggest you
   upgrade ASAP.
AZ ADD: enhanced configure and Makefile. Now "./configure; make" should
   be enough at least under Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD. configure has options,
   try ./configure --help. Also FIX: a `make clean' issue.
AZ FIX: a bug in rtt.c, in some circumstance it returned a negative rtt,
   also ADD: an initial sanity check for faster problem tracing in rtt.c.
   Now sent packets are registered into 'delay table' *before* of sending, I
   think this isn't the better way to do a good timing, but since original ping
   program use this way and it avoids some problem hping now use this solution.
AZ FIX: parseoptions.c, some parser fix and more limits for non root users.
AZ ADD: better hgetopt.c, now it's possible to combine short options like
   -S -F etc in -SF. The same kind of bug seems still unfixed in gcc and ssh.
AZ if_promisc.c no longer compiled/linked since it isn't used by hping2.
   I leave this file here for possible future new features. It will be needed
   only for Linux since to set promiscuous mode with libpcap it is not useful.
AZ ADD:/FIX: getlhs.c updated, now system dependent, BSD ethernet names
   updated thx to Rui Miguel Barbosa Machado <rmbm@rccn.net>,
   FIX: BSD PPP link header size (I hope). Please send me a mail if you
   successfully run hping2 under PPP interface on BSD.
AZ ADD: new `utils' directory added and the simple utility hex2bin
AZ ADD: distribution enhanced, CHANGES was extracted from TODO, MIRRORS contain
   a mirrors list, BUGS the bug report form, others files added.
